# Python Object-Oriented Programming

# What is a Object-Oriented Programming?
# Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the 
# concept of "objects", which can contain data, in the form of fields 
# (often known as attributes or properties), and code, in the form of
# procedures (often known as methods).

# Why OOP?
# 1. Maintainability
# 2. Reusability
# 4. Modularity
